# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.

## The Gate Function

```
BEFORE claiming any status:

1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim

Skip any step = lying, not verifying
```

## Common Failures

| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass" |
| Linter clean | Linter output: 0 errors | Partial check, extrapolation |
| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing, logs look good |
| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |
| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist | Tests passing alone |
| Subagent completed | VCS diff shows changes | Agent reports "success" |

## Red Flags — STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Done!", "Perfect!")
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports without checking
- Relying on partial verification
- Thinking "just this once"
- Tired and wanting work over
- ANY wording implying success without having run verification

## Key Patterns

**Tests:**
```
✅ `npm test` → 34/34 pass → "All tests pass"
❌ "Should pass now" / "Looks correct"
```

**Bug fixes:**
```
✅ Write regression test → Run (fail) → Apply fix → Run (pass) → "Bug fixed, regression test passes"
❌ "Code changed, should work now"
```

**Build:**
```
✅ `npm run build` → exit 0 → "Build succeeds"
❌ "Linter passed" (linter doesn't check compilation)
```

**Requirements:**
```
✅ Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each item → Report gaps or completion
❌ "Tests pass, phase complete"
```

**Subagent delegation:**
```
✅ Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state
❌ Trust agent report
```

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Should work now" | RUN the verification. |
| "I'm confident" | Confidence ≠ evidence. |
| "Just this once" | No exceptions. |
| "Linter passed" | Linter ≠ compiler. |
| "Agent said success" | Verify independently. |
| "I'm tired" | Exhaustion ≠ excuse. |
| "Partial check is enough" | Partial proves nothing. |

## When To Apply

**ALWAYS before:**
- ANY success/completion claims
- ANY expression of satisfaction
- ANY positive statement about work state
- Committing, PR creation, task completion
- Moving to next task

**Rule applies to:** exact phrases, paraphrases, synonyms, implications, ANY communication suggesting completion.

## The Bottom Line

Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result.

This is non-negotiable.
